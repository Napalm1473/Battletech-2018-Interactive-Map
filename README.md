If you have the skills that pay the bills and would like to help, please do not hesitate to 
submit an edit or contact me directly to discuss further. I am only learning all of this for 
the first time as of a few days before posting this so I could use all the help I can get!

Planned features when I figure out how to do them/have the spare time:
- Make filters work as filters instead of stacking, ie, research + mining shows only 
  research + mining planes, not planets with EITHER research OR mining
- Search function
- Names of planets shown by default, not just on popups
- Recommended jump paths for optimal shop hunting
